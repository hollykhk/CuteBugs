# ScaryBugs
ScaryBugs is an iOS app that I had written when I was a sophomore in High School. It was written in Objective-C. I can't access to it for quite a long time, because that batteries was not working and AC adaptor of the old laptop is broken. Now I fixed AC adaptor and that old laptop is still able to work. I donated the old laptop to a non profit local computer science organization that help economically disadvantaged children to learn programming. Before I sent it to them, I backed up all my files to a cloud, and I notced that that iOS app was still in the laptop.
